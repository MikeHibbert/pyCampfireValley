  "description": "A Python library that extends the Campfires framework by introducing the concept of \"valleys\" as interconnected, secure communities of campfires. The library manages docks as gateways for inter-valley communication, handles riverboat (torch) exchanges via MCP, and provides default campfires for loading/offloading, security sanitization, and justice enforcement.",
